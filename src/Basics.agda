-- Rank of a weight biased leftist heap defined as number of nodes in
-- a heap.
Rank : Set
Rank = Nat

-- Priority assigned to elements stored in a Heap.
--
-- CONVENTION: Lower number means higher Priority. Therefore the highest
-- Priority is zero. It will sometimes be more convenient not to use this
-- inversed terminology. We will then use terms "smaller" and "greater" (in
-- contrast to "lower" and "higher"). Example: Priority 3 is higher than 5, but
-- 3 is smaller than 5.
Priority : Set
Priority = Nat

-- Note that both Rank and Priority are Nat, which allows us to
-- operate on them with functions that work for Nat.
