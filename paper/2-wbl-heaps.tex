\section{Weight biased leftist heaps}\label{sec:wblh}

A heap is a tree-based data structure used to implement priority queue. Each node in the heap satisfies \textit{priority property}: priority of element at the node is not lower than priority of the children nodes\footnote{I will also refer to children of a node as ``subtrees'' or ``subheaps''.}. Element with the highest priority is stored at the root. Access to it has O(1) complexity.

Weight biased leftist tree \cite{ChoSah96} is a binary tree that satisfies \textit{rank property}: for each node rank of its left child is not smaller than rank of its right child. Rank of a tree is defined as its size (number of nodes). Weight biased leftist tree that satisfies priority property is called a weight biased leftist heap.

\textit{Right spine} of a node is the rightmost path from that node to an empty node. From priority property it follows that right spine of a weight biased leftist heap is an ordered list\footnote{In fact, any path from root to a leaf is!}. Two weight biased leftist heaps can be merged in O(log~n) time by merging their right spines in the same way one merges ordered lists and then swapping children along the right spine of merged heap to restore rank property \cite{Oka99}. Inserting new element into weight biased leftist heap can be defined as merging existing heap with a newly created singleton heap. Deleting element with the highest priority can be defined as merging children of the root element.
