There are a number of next steps you can take. One possibility is learning how to use \texttt{â‰¡-Reasoning} module located in \texttt{Relation.}\texttt{Binary.}\texttt{PropositionalEquality} module of Agda's standard library. It provides notation identical to the one introduced in Section \ref{sec:eq-proofs-using-trans}. Another step to take is learning Idris \cite{Bra13} to see how to conduct proofs using tactics.
