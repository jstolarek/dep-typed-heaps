\section{Summary and further reading}

This paper demonstrated a simple technique for building complex equality proofs by composing elementary equalities using transitivity. Understanding this approach allows the reader to learn more advanced techniques offered by dependently typed languages. Possible next steps include learning mechanisms offered by Agda's standard library, namely the \texttt{â‰¡-Reasoning} located in \texttt{Relation.} \texttt{Binary.}\texttt{PropositionalEquality} module, which provides notation identical to the one introduced in Section~\ref{sec:eq-proofs-using-trans}. Another step to take is learning how to conduct proofs using tactics in languages such as Idris \cite{Bra13} or Coq \cite{coq}.

Due to space limitations some parts of the companion code were left out from the discussion. The reader may now wish to take a look at verification of priority invariant in two-pass and single-pass implementations of \texttt{merge} and simultaneous proofs of rank and priority invariants.
