\section{Introduction}
% Purpose of this paper is to present formal verification of a known purely functional data structure (well known).

\subsection{Companion code}

This tutorial comes with companion code available at my web page \cite{js-webhome}\footnote{``Living'' version of companion code is available at GitHub \cite{js-github}.}. Code is written in Agda 2.3.3, which is a development version of the compiler as of Januray 2014. See Agda Wiki \cite{agda-wiki} for instructions how to install development version of Agda. I assume that the reader is reading the companion code along with the paper. Due to space limitations I elide some proofs that are described in detail in the companion code.

\subsection{Assumptions and conventions}

I assume that reader has basic understanding of Agda and using dependent types to conduct proofs. In particular I assume that reader is familiar with definition of natural numbers (\texttt{Nat}s) and their addition (\texttt{+}) as well as proofs of basic properties of addition like associativity, commutativity or 0 as right identity ($a + 0 â‰¡ a$). Reader should also understand \texttt{refl} with its basic properties (symmetry, congruence, transitivity and substitution), know the concept of ``data as evidence'' and other ideas presented in ``Why Dependent Types Matter'' \cite{AltMcBMcK05} as we will build upon them.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper contains following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item % explains how to build equality proofs using transitivity, allows this basic thing allows to understand more complex stuff (standard library).
 \item % how to construct proofs from smaller proofs when code is transformed
 \item % picking up were other tutorials left
 \item % demonstrating how to verify a well known functional data structure using techniques developed earlier
\end{itemize}
