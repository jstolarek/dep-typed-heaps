\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Companion code}

This tutorial comes with companion code available at author's web page and GitHub \cite{js-github}. Code is written in Agda 2.3.3, which is a development version of the compiler as of Januray 2014. See Agda Wiki for instructions how to install development version of Agda. I assume that the reader is reading the companion code along with the paper. Due to space limitations I elide some proofs that are described in detail in the companion code.

\subsection{Assumptions and conventions}

I assume that reader has basic understanding of Agda and using dependent types to conduct proofs. In particular I assume that reader is familiar with \texttt{refl} and its basic properties: symmetry, congruence, transitivity and substitution. I also assume that reader understands proofs of basic properties of addition like associativity, commutativity or 0 as right identity ($a + 0 â‰¡ a$). The reader should also know the concept of ``data as evidence'' and be familiar with ideas presented in ``Why Dependent Types Matter'' \cite{AltMcBMcK05} as we will build upon them.

A good introduction to Agda and proofs can be found in and  as well as some online resources .

\subsection{Contributions}

Contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
 \item % explains how to build equality proofs using transitivity, allows this basic thing allows to understand more complex stuff (standard library).
 \item % how to construct proofs from smaller proofs when code is transformed
 \item % picking up were other tutorials left
 \item % demonstrating how to verify a well known functional data structure using techniques developed earlier
\end{itemize}


% Purpose of this paper is to present formal verification of a known purely functional data structure (well known).

% assume faimiliarity with evidence as data and singleton types. - Why dep types matter
% assumptions: definition of natual numbers, +, congruence, refl, symmetry, transitivity, substitution.
