\begin{abstract}
This paper is an intermediate level tutorial on verification using dependent types in Agda. It is also a case study of weight biased leftist heap data structure in a purely functional, dependently typed setting. Paper demonstrates how to write a formally verified implementation that is guaranteed to maintain that structure's invariants. The reader will learn how to construct complex equality proofs by building them from smaller parts. This knowledge will enable the reader to understand more advanced techniques, eg. equational reasoning provided by Agda's standard library or tactics system found in Idris programming language.
